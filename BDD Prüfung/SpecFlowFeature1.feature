    As a math idiot
    I want to be told the sum of two numbers

Scenario: Sinus
    Given the first number is PI
    When sinus is taken
    Then the result should be 0

Scenario: Cosinus
    Given the first number is PI
    When cosinus is taken
    Then the result should be -1

Scenario: Tangens
    Given the first number is PI
    When tangens is taken
    Then the result should be 0
